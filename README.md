This project aims at exploring different concepts of NLP with a movie_ tv_show dataset. We explored issues like the most important genres, the spread of added movies and tv_shows across years and months, recommendation, and apply classification algorithms on the text description dataset.   

The notebook investigated concepts like: removing punctuation, tokenize, lemmatize, stemming, stop words,  Create dictionary of the most frequent words and Word Cloud, Gensim and spacy libraries, apply Recommender system, use of Bag of words (unigram, bigram, …), exploring different models (random forest, gradient boost, Naïve Bayes) with vectorized data made with count vectorizer, TFIDF, analyzing similarity between reviews description  and Classification with kmean clustering with the use of Elbow method.
